\section{Definitions} 

\textbf{Tournament} - is a directed graph such that $\forall v,u\in V(T)$ only one of the two edges $(v,u),(u,v)$ is in $E(T)$ \\
\\
\textbf{Hyperedge} - is an edge with 2 or more vertices (e.g. $\{v_1,v_2,...,v_n\})$ \\
\\
\textbf{Hypergraph} - is a generalization of a graph where $\forall e\in E$ is a hyperedge \\
\\
\textbf{k-uniform hypergraph} - is a hypergraph where $\forall e\in E$, $|e|=k$ (a graph is 2-uniform hypergraph)\\
\\
\textbf{K-Tournament} - is a complete k-uniform hypergraph where each edge has a special vertex called tail.\\
\\
\textbf{Domination (2-Tournament)} - we say that X dominates Y if every vertex in $ Y\setminus X$ is adjacent from some vertex in X.\\
\\
\textbf{Domination (k-Tournament)} - we say that X dominates Y if every vertex in $ Y\setminus X$ is in a hyperedge where the tail is in X.\\
